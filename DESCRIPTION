Description: Commuting zones are geographic areas where people live and work and
  are useful for understanding local economies, as well as how they differ from 
  traditional boundaries. These zones are a set of boundary shapes built using 
  aggregated estimates of home and work locations. Data used to build commuting 
  zones is aggregated and de-identified.
